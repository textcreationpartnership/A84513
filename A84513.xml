            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing lately in <hi>Kent,</hi> to ſpeed out the Fleet, that an Eaſterly winde might not prevent their ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable getting forth of the River; And receiving notice of an Ordinance of Parliament, whereby the Members of both Houſes, holding Offices under their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112938:3"/> Authority, ſtand diſcharged after the end of Forty dayes, I thought it my duty, (after my giving in charge to the Captaines, then in thoſe parts, to bee faithfull in their Truſts) to make my returne backe, that I might teſtifie my cheerfull Compliance with the Houſes Reſolution.</p>
            <p>While I have had the Honour to ſerve the Parliament in the great Truſt by them repoſed in me, both ſince my being Lord Admirall, and before, I have endeavoured to performe my Duty, with fidelity, and diligence, being acted therein by no other deſigne, but a deſire to advance Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and my Countries Service. And my Endeavou's (though accompanied with thoſe common Infirmities that are incident to men) have (through the bleſſing and goodneſſe of God) not been without ſome viſible advantage to the Publique, being made inſtrumentall to preſerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Intereſt in the Fleet, when it was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112938:3"/> laboured with Letters, and Commands under the broad Seale, from his Majeſtie, to be turned againſt them; And ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hath accrued to the State by the relei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our Friends, and interception of Supplies intended to the Enemy; Beſides thoſe leſſe obſervable preventions of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which without a vigilant eye, might have infeſted the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But as I did, in obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of both Houſes, Receive, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Mannage that employment, ſo did my heart, with all poſſible readineſſe, ſubmit to their pleaſure, ſo ſoone as it was held forth in that Ordinance. And therefore, in teſtification of that high and honourable eſteem that I owe, and ſincerely beare to their wiſedomes, I do with al humility, and cheerfullneſſe, reſigne and ſurrender into their hands, the Office of Lord Admirall where with they were pleaſed formerly to intruſt me, And ſhall value it as my higheſt honour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112938:4"/> next to my God, to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, and my Country in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition where into his providence ſhall caſt me. Not counting my Perſon, nor deereſt intereſts, too pretious to be layd out in maintenance of that great cauſe of Religion, and Liberty, wherein they are ſo juſtly engaged. And in all their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my faithfull and ready Concurrence ſhall demonſtrate to all the world, That my higheſt ambition is, no other, then, to contribute my beſt endeavour for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And that I am reſolved to ſtand, and fall with them in the upholding of Gods truth, and the publique Liberty; knowing well by many yeares experience, that the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this Kingdom, cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods bleſſing in the preſervation, and ſafety of the Parliament, <hi>Which</hi> I here preſent, as the reall, and can did expreſſions of a minde, full of integrity, and humble reſpect towards them.</p>
